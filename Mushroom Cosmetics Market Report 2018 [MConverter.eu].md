**1. Introduction to Mushroom-Based Cosmetics**

**1.1 What Are Mushroom Cosmetics?**

Mushroom cosmetics refer to beauty and personal care products that
utilize mushroom extracts, such as Reishi, Chaga, Shiitake, Cordyceps,
and Tremella, as core ingredients. These mushrooms are rich in
polysaccharides, beta-glucans, and antioxidants, which are known to
promote skin healing, hydration, and protection against environmental
stressors.

With the rising popularity of functional foods and adaptogens, mushrooms
have transcended their culinary uses to become powerful allies in
skincare and haircare. Mushroom-based cosmetics are positioned at the
intersection of natural wellness and scientifically backed skincare,
making them an attractive option for modern consumers seeking holistic
beauty solutions.

Mushroom cosmetics are not just a passing trend---they reflect a broader
movement toward clean beauty. Consumers are increasingly scrutinizing
product labels, seeking plant-based, cruelty-free, and chemical-free
alternatives. As a result, brands offering mushroom-infused products are
carving out a unique niche within the competitive beauty landscape.
